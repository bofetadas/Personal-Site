        <h1>Max</h1>
        <p><em>Student and employee at <a href="https://evitado.io/">Evitado Technologies</a></em></p>
        <p>With the return from his gap year in New Zealand Max decided to kick off his education as a Software Developer. Having always had interest in computer science but never really came into contact with it during his time in highschool, he
          felt this
          is the right way to go. That’s why he was enrolled in the Media Systems Bachelor’s Degree at HAW Hamburg where he was taught the fundamentals of mobile application development. These skills allowed him to become part of the Evitado team in
          August
          ’19 as he develops the enduser interface. With his Master’s Degree coming up in April ‘21 he wants to shift his focus towards robotics and artificial intelligence.
          In Max’ spare time he enjoys meeting with friends, playing the piano or discover new places everywhere in the world.</p>
